    <P>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
        <ol>
            <li>Walla Walla,WA</li>
            <li>Magic City,ID</li>
            <li>Bountiful,UT</li>
            <li>Lasblockt Chance,CO</li>
            <li>Truth or Consequences,NM</li>
            <li>Why,AZ</li>
        </ol>

        <P>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
            <blockquote>"Passing cars,</br>
                When you can't see, </br>
                May get you,</br>
                A glimpse,</br>
                Of eternity." </blockquote>
            I definitely won't be passing any cars.</P>
        <h2>June 2, 2012</h2> My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
        <ul>
            <li>cellphone</li>
            <li>iPod</li>
            <li>digital camera</li>
            <li>a protein bar</li>
        </ul>
        Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said,
        <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
